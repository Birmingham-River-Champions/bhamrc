<p><b>Anglers Riverfly Monitoring Initiative (ARMI) score</b> is an indicator of the river's ecological health.
It is calculated by adding the 'sensitivity scores' of Urban Riverfly species sampled. For this, higher values are
assigned to <b> pollution-sensitive species</b>, and this score increases when they are recorded  in higher numbers. The opposite is used for more <b> pollution tolerant species</b>. Higher ARMI scores suggest healthier ecosystems and better water quality (i.e., less polluted) conditions. </p>

<p> <b>But</b> there are things to bear in mind (these things are never straight forward)! ARMI can depend on how effectively species are being recorded - such as a size 10 welly collecting more bugs than a size 5 one! Also, the ARMI score has <b>not</b> been widely tested to Urban Riverfly,
so Birmingham River Champion's data will help <b>improve</b> the reliability
of this national recording scheme (see <a href='https://www.riverflies.org/urban-riverfly' target='_blank'>here</a> for further details).</p>
