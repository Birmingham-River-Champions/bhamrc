## Accessibility Statement
    
This statement applies to this website ([birminghamriverchampions.shinyapps.io](https://birminghamriverchampions.shinyapps.io/BirminghamRiverChampions/))

The website was improved by the [Research Software Group](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/bear-software) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). We are committed to improving accessibility and are actively working to enhance the user experience for everyone. 

### How accessible is the website

While we aim to make the website as accessible as possible, we are aware of some areas that are not currently fully accessible:
+ The "Your Data" tab contains a map with pop-up graphs that appear when map points are clicked on. These points are not keyboard accessible and use colour to denote data. However, the spatial data for these graphs may be downloaded at the "View Submitted Data" tab.
+ The map zoom control is not keyboard accessible.
+ The newsletters and other resources provided by the site may not be accessible to those using screen readers.

    
Despite these limitations, users should be able to:

+ Zoom in up to 300% without problems
+ Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
+ Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
+ Use most of the website with a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver)
+ Understand data tables and charts, which include descriptive labels for clarity
+ View content with color contrast designed to meet accessibility guidelines
+ Download the data which is displayed visually or using colour as a primary information source.
